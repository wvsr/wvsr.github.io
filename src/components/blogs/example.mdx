This is an example of a blog post written in MDX.
You can use standard markdown syntax, as well as JSX components.

## This is a Heading 2

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

> This is a blockquote. It's useful for highlighting a section of text.

### This is a Heading 3

Here is a list of items:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And here is a numbered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

You can also include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

You can add links to other pages:

Or images from your `public` directory:

You can also embed JSX components directly in your markdown:

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: '#eee', borderRadius: '5px' }}>
  This is a React component inside a markdown file!
</div>
