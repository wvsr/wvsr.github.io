          I discovered programming at the age of 12 while adding custom blocks
          to my blogger website. I could add custom blocks with something
          called html and decorate them with something called css. I got the
          superpower.

          I had to create a Jarvis like robot. After gliding on youtube, I
          found some videos where people made dummy Jarvis clones with python.
          And yep, I learned it. But I never actually built a Jarvis. Because
          by that time, I had also discovered Flask. While playing with it, I
          somehow moved on to django. I built some cool stuff with
          django, including my own social media platform. I had to
          learn JavaScript first. And that thing was complete chaos. But I
          survived. Thanks to the new hot topic called React. I started

          playing with React because there were tons of cool libraries around
          it, and it was easy to add. I had already watched some videos on it
          anyway. Back then, I used bootstrap, but material ui always
          intrigued me. It had that fancy ripple effect on buttons. Most
          probably, I learned react just to use material.

          I don't remember what happened after that. Everything is a
          jumble.
